# database_in_mmorpg_climate

I just wrote this short database, just to practice some code and queries.

Names of birds as “Name”? Why not!

Database in mmorpg climate - like in the old times when played more!

I created databases with extentions: 
.vsc 
.xlsx 
.txt

Now it is a time to do some queries...
